Learning is interesting! So is stuff happening on social media!

Let's do both!

---

Over the past few months of lurking on Twitter, I've noticed that every once
in a while two hashtags will get going that end up 'dualing' with one another.
Recent examples have been #YesAllWomen vs. #NotAllMen and #LivingWhileBlack
vs. #CrimingWhileWhite. Seems to me that there's a dialog characteristic to
this sort of social media happening that ends up being harder to capture than
it would be if the converstaion were happening on a single hashtag, for
example.

Now, I doubt this is necessarily a noval observation, and it's possible that
the sort of analysis I intend to do is being done already, but what the heck,
ya know?

One of the primary blocks in the road to an interesting result here is actually
getting enough data to say something relevant here. As it stands now, I get the
impression that the battle between #CrimingWhileWhite and #LivingWhileBlack has
cooled down somewhat, at least to the point that gathering enough tweets one
the those two hashtags is unlikely to happen. I didn't manage to get this idea
working well enough quick enough.

So I guess I'll keep an eye out for the next pair!

TODO

- [X] Find a suitable Python wrapper for the Twitter API
- [X] Use the API to get tweets (probs about something topical)
- [X] Put tweets in a db of some sort. (.csv is best db)
- [ ] Give those tweets to scikit-learn
- [ ] Color inside the lines drawn in [this talk](http://opensource.datacratic.com/mtlpy50/)
- [ ] Arrive at an interesting result
